| The simplest and most common data structure in R is the vector.

...



  |                                                                            
  |==                                                                    |   3%
| Vectors come in two different flavors: atomic vectors and lists. An atomic
| vector contains exactly one data type, whereas a list may contain multiple
| data types. We'll explore atomic vectors further before we get to lists.

...



  |                                                                            
  |====                                                                  |   5%
| In previous lessons, we dealt entirely with numeric vectors, which are one
| type of atomic vector. Other types of atomic vectors include logical,
| character, integer, and complex. In this lesson, we'll take a closer look at
| logical and character vectors.

...



  |                                                                            
  |======                                                                |   8%
| Logical vectors can contain the values TRUE, FALSE, and NA (for 'not
| available'). These values are generated as the result of logical
| 'conditions'. Let's experiment with some simple conditions.

...



  |                                                                            
  |========                                                              |  11%
| First, create a numeric vector num_vect that contains the values 0.5, 55,
| -10, and 6.

> num_vect <- c(0.5,55,-10,6)
num_vect <- c(0.5,55,-10,6)

| That's a job well done!


  |                                                                            
  |=========                                                             |  14%
| Now, create a variable called tf that gets the result of num_vect < 1, which
| is read as 'num_vect is less than 1'.

> tf <- num_vect < 1
tf <- num_vect < 1

| Great job!


  |                                                                            
  |===========                                                           |  16%
| What do you think tf will look like?

  |=============                                                         |  19%
| Print the contents of tf now.

[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

| You are really on a roll!


  |                                                                            
  |===============                                                       |  22%
| The statement num_vect < 1 is a condition and tf tells us whether each
| corresponding element of our numeric vector num_vect satisfies this
| condition.

...



  |                                                                            
  |=================                                                     |  24%
| The first element of num_vect is 0.5, which is less than 1 and therefore the
| statement 0.5 < 1 is TRUE. The second element of num_vect is 55, which is
| greater than 1, so the statement 55 < 1 is FALSE. The same logic applies for
| the third and forth elements.

...



  |                                                                            
  |===================                                                   |  27%
| Let's try another. Type num_vect >= 6 without assigning the result to a new
| variable.

> num_vect >= 6
num_vect >= 6
[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

| You are quite good my friend!


  |                                                                            
  |=====================                                                 |  30%
| This time, we are asking whether each individual element of num_vect is
| greater than OR equal to 6. Since only 55 and 6 are greater than or equal to
| 6, the second and forth elements of the result are TRUE and the first and
| third elements are FALSE.

...



  |                                                                            
  |=======================                                               |  32%
| The `<` and `>=` symbols in these examples are called 'logical operators'.
| Other logical operators include `>`, `<=`, `==` for exact equality, and `!=`
| for inequality.

...



  |                                                                            
  |=========================                                             |  35%
| If we have two logical expressions, A and B, we can ask whether at least one
| is TRUE with A | B (logical 'or' a.k.a. 'union') or whether they are both
| TRUE with A & B (logical 'and' a.k.a. 'intersection'). Lastly, !A is the
| negation of A and is TRUE when A is FALSE and vice versa.

...



  |                                                                            
  |==========================                                            |  38%
| It's a good idea to spend some time playing around with various combinations
| of these logical operators until you get comfortable with their use. We'll do
| a few examples here to get you started.

...



  |

| Don't worry if you found these to be tricky. They're supposed to be. Working
| with logical statements in R takes practice, but your efforts will be
| rewarded in future lessons (e.g. subsetting and control structures).

...



  |                                                                            
  |======================================                                |  54%
| Character vectors are also very common in R. Double quotes are used to
| distinguish character objects, as in the following example.

...



  |                                                                            
  |========================================                              |  57%
| Create a character vector that contains the following words: "My", "name",
| "is". Remember to enclose each word in it's own set of double quotes, so that
| R knows they are character strings. Store the vector in a variable called
| my_char.

> my_char <- c("My","name","is")
my_char <- c("My","name","is")

| Keep up the great work!


  |                                                                            
  |==========================================                            |  59%
| Print the contents of my_char to see what it looks like.

> my_char
my_char
[1] "My"   "name" "is"  

| That's correct!


  |                                                                            
  |============================================                          |  62%
| Right now, my_char is a character vector of length 3. Let's say we want to
| join the elements of my_char together into one continuous character string
| (i.e. a character vector of length 1). We can do this using the paste()
| function.

...



  |                                                                            
  |=============================================                         |  65%
| Type paste(my_char, collapse = " ") now. Make sure there's a space between
| the double quotes in the `collapse` argument. You'll see why in a second.

> paste(my_char,collapse = " ")
paste(my_char,collapse = " ")
[1] "My name is"

| Nice work!


  |                                                                            
  |===============================================                       |  68%
| The `collapse` argument to the paste() function tells R that when we join
| together the elements of the my_char character vector, we'd like to separate
| them with single spaces.

...



  |                                                                            
  |=================================================                     |  70%
| It seems that we're missing something.... Ah, yes! Your name!

...



  |                                                                            
  |===================================================                   |  73%
| To add (or 'concatenate') your name to the end of my_char, use the c()
| function like this: c(my_char, "your_name_here"). Place your name in double
| quotes where I've put "your_name_here". Try it now, storing the result in a
| new variable called my_name.

> my_name <- c(my_char,"pacha")
my_name <- c(my_char,"pacha")

| That's a job well done!


  |                                                                            
  |=====================================================                 |  76%
| Take a look at the contents of my_name.

  |=======================================================               |  78%
| Now, use the paste() function once more to join the words in my_name together
| into a single character string. Don't forget to say collapse = " "!

> paste(my_name,collapse = " ")
paste(my_name,collapse = " ")
[1] "My name is pacha"

| You got it!


  |                                                                            
  |=========================================================             |  81%
| In this example, we used the paste() function to collapse the elements of a
| single character vector. paste() can also be used to join the elements of
| multiple character vectors.

...



  |                                                                            
  |===========================================================           |  84%
| In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each of
| length 1 (i.e. join two words). Try paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " "),
| where the `sep` argument tells R that we want to separate the joined elements
| with a single space.

> paste("Hello","world!",sep=" ")
paste("Hello","world!",sep=" ")
[1] "Hello world!"

| Nice work!


  |                                                                            
  |=============================================================         |  86%
| For a slightly more complicated example, we can join two vectors, each of
| length 3. Use paste() to join the numeric vector 1:3 (recall this is the same
| as c(1, 2, 3)) with the character vector c("X", "Y", "Z"). This time, use sep
| = "" to leave no space between the joined elements.

> paste(c(1,2,3),c("X","Y","Z"),sep="")
paste(c(1,2,3),c("X","Y","Z"),sep="")
[1] "1X" "2Y" "3Z"

| You almost had it, but not quite. Try again. Or, type info() for more
| options.

| Use paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "") to see what happens when we join
| two vectors of equal length using paste().

> paste(1:3,c("X","Y","Z"),sep="")
paste(1:3,c("X","Y","Z"),sep="")
[1] "1X" "2Y" "3Z"

| You are doing so well!


  |                                                                            
  |==============================================================        |  89%
| What do you think will happen if our vectors are of different length? (Hint:
| we talked about this in a previous lesson.)

...



  |                                                                            
  |================================================================      |  92%
| Vector recycling! Try paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-"), where LETTERS is a
| predefined variable in R containing a character vector of all 26 letters in
| the English alphabet.

> paste(LETTERS,1:4,sep="-")
paste(LETTERS,1:4,sep="-")
 [1] "A-1" "B-2" "C-3" "D-4" "E-1" "F-2" "G-3" "H-4" "I-1" "J-2" "K-3" "L-4"
[13] "M-1" "N-2" "O-3" "P-4" "Q-1" "R-2" "S-3" "T-4" "U-1" "V-2" "W-3" "X-4"
[25] "Y-1" "Z-2"

| Nice work!


  |                                                                            
  |==================================================================    |  95%
| Since the character vector LETTERS is longer than the numeric vector 1:4, R
| simply recycles, or repeats, 1:4 until it matches the length of LETTERS.

...



  |                                                                            
  |====================================================================  |  97%
| Also worth noting is that the numeric vector 1:4 gets 'coerced' into a
| character vector by the paste() function.

...



  |                                                                            
  |======================================================================| 100%
| We'll discuss coercion in another lesson, but all it really means that the
| numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the output above are no longer numbers to R, but
| rather characters "1", "2", "3", and "4".
